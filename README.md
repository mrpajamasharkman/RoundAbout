# RoundAbout
Android Application for counting tabletop RPG initiative effects over time. RoundAbout will work with any system that uses initiative, and works best with a static initiative, rolling once when an actor enters an initiative scenario and only changing order in unique circumstances.

Currently entirely unfinished. UI needs work, and there are some design considerations I need to take into account, such as effects self-deleting on specific initiative counts, or actors readying actions/delaying their turns.
